7 months ago I started a 3 month jounrey...

A year ago I started looking into bookcamps - I had been taking udemy calsses and other tutorial for years but I had never sat down to learn  - well not in over 30 years anyway...

I did precourse work for Hack Reactor, Fullstack Academy, and Flat Iron School, and although I was accepted to all three, only Flat Iron had a teaching method I felt comfortable with so I joined March 8th!

It didn't take long to be derailed off the 3 month plan - My wife and I bought a house and that process ate into study/work time alot...  Then I was lucky enough to be chosen for a pilot program of cohorts with Flat Iron and while that felt much better and I believe I learned a lot more because of it - it did take much longer...  but, I had a life all summer too!

There were days and sometimes weeks of stress but in the end it has all been worth it!!

I have my final review today and once I pass that it is full time job hunting!
