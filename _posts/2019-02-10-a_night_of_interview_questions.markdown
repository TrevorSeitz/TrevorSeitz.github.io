I recently went to a meet-up where there was a speaker talking about interview questions and how to approach them.  There were about 8 of us there with experience levels from me (a recent bootcamp grad) to some with over seven years experience.  We did one example as a large group (the merge-sort problem - sort the array [0, 17, 29, 4, 55, 70, 8, 83, 85] from lowest to highest). The main thing we learned from that example is to break the problem down to it’s base assumptions.  For the merge sort problem, the base assumption is that if an array has one or zero items in it, it is sorted and ready to be compared to other sorted arrays.  It was like seeing a magicians secret when I saw just what it takes to perform  “array.sort((a, b) => a - b)”.

We took a shot at another problem ( the stairs problem - not easy to explain, so here is a[ link to the google search:](https://www.google.com/search?q=stair+interview+problem&as_qdr=y&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS723US723&{google:acceptedSuggestion}oq=stair+interview+problem&aqs=chrome..69i57.7375j0j4&sourceid=chrome&{google:instantExtendedEnabledParameter}ie=UTF-8)) but it was not nearly as easy to understand.  No body was able to solve that problem completely although just about everyone understood how to problem breaks down.

I think in the end it was more a learning experience that interview problems are hard, no matter what your skill level is or how long you have been coding - And that even when you can solve the problem in English, it may be hard to translate to code.
