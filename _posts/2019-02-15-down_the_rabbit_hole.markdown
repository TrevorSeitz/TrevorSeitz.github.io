Sometimes you are just certain something can be done, or done a certain way.

Sometimes you are right…

Sometimes you spend a day thinking you are smarter than all those other developers and the answer is simple - just one more try - maybe if I call that function here… But the data is right there - wait, where did it go…

Sometimes you “waste” a whole day doing what you thought could be done…

It’s not a waste of a day!

You learned what happens when you change your patterns or change how you send/receive data.  You learned how to troubleshoot new processes and think through how to change your code.

Most of all you learned that there are other ways to do things.  That the way you want may not be possible (yet).  You have learned how to adapt from the best user experience to the best possible experience!!
