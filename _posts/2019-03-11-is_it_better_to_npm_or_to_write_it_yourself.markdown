For my current project I needed to find a way to use Expo's ImagePicker to pick multiple photos.  I search many ways and all I could find was... you can't.

So I searched for work arounds and found a couple of npm packages.  I installed the one that sounded best and off I went.  It wasn't perfect but I was able to write and rewrite code to make work the way I wanted.

Weeks later I hit a bit of a wall and now I am going to have to redo the ImagePicker.  Which is fine - I am much more confident with React Native and I understand the process I will need to impliment.

So, I would say that it is better to use a npm package if there is something huge that you need to create and you don't have time, or if you need something you don't quite understand how to do on your own but don't do it simply because it is easier - because you may end up doing more work to make it suit your project that if you had written it yourself.
